# AGROCROP  
### Smart Agricultural Assistance and Resource Platform

AGROCROP is a digital agriculture platform designed to support farmers through a unified system that combines crop advisory, land rental, machinery access, weather insights, and government scheme information within a single application.

This repository currently contains the UI/UX prototype created in Figma. Functional development is planned for the next phase.

## Core Modules

### 1. Authentication
- User signup  
- Login  
- Password recovery  
- Account-based dashboard access  

Provides secure and personalized access to platform features.

---

### 2. Weather Dashboard
- Temperature display  
- Humidity and wind information  
- Precipitation details  
- Location-based weather overview  

Enables users to make informed cultivation decisions based on environmental conditions.

---

### 3. Land Rental Marketplace
- Location-based plot search  
- Price filtering  
- Plot size and facing details  
- Road width information  
- Owner details with contact option  

Users can browse available agricultural land and directly connect with landowners.

---

### 4. Tools and Machinery Rental
- Equipment browsing interface  
- Sorting and rating system  
- Detailed specifications (e.g., horsepower, torque, transmission type)  
- Rental and purchase options  

Includes listings such as tractors with technical specifications and monthly rental pricing.

---

### 5. Crop Advisory
- Location selection  
- Crop selection  
- Suitability indicator (scale-based recommendation)  
- Yield potential overview  

Crop insights include:
- Soil type requirements  
- Temperature range  
- Best cultivation months  
- Common threats  
- Water and humidity needs  

This module is designed to evolve into a data-driven crop recommendation and yield prediction system.

---

### 6. Government Schemes Information

Structured information on major agricultural schemes including:
- PM-KISAN  
- PM-KMY  
- PMFBY  
- MISS  

Each scheme provides:
- Description  
- Financial support details  
- Eligibility overview  

---

## Problem Statement

Farmers often depend on fragmented and disconnected sources for:

- Land rental  
- Equipment access  
- Crop planning  
- Weather data  
- Government benefits  

AGROCROP aims to centralize these essential agricultural services within a single digital platform to improve accessibility and decision-making.
