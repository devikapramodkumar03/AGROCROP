# AGROCROP
Smart Agricultural Assistance and Resource Platform

AGROCROP is a digital agriculture platform designed to support farmers with crop advisory, land rental, machinery access, weather insights, and government scheme information in a single application.

This repository currently contains the UI/UX prototype designed in Figma. Development is planned for the next phase.

The prototype demonstrates complete user flow and feature structure.

Core Modules
1. Authentication

* User signup

* Login

* Password recovery

* Account-based dashboard access

2. Weather Dashboard

* Temperature display

* Humidity and wind information

* Precipitation details

* Location-based overview

This allows users to consider environmental conditions before planning cultivation.

3. Land Rental Marketplace

* Location-based plot search

* Price filtering

* Plot size and facing details

* Road width information

* Owner details and contact option

Users can browse agricultural land and directly connect with landowners.

4. Tools and Machinery Rental

* Equipment browsing interface

* Sorting and rating system

* Detailed specifications (e.g., horsepower, torque, transmission type)

* Rental and purchase options

Example listings include tractors with technical specifications and monthly rental pricing.

5. Crop Advisory

* Location selection

* Crop selection

* Suitability indicator (scale from worst to best choice)

* Yield potential overview

Crop requirements: Soil type, Temperature range, Best cultivation months, Common threats, Water and humidity needs

This module is intended to evolve into a data-driven crop recommendation system in future development.

6. Government Schemes Information

Includes structured information on agricultural schemes such as: PM-KISAN, PM-KMY, PMFBY, MISS
Each scheme provides description, financial support details, and eligibility overview.

Problem Statement

Farmers often rely on fragmented sources for:

* Land rental

* Equipment access

* Crop planning

* Weather information

* Government benefits

AGROCROP aims to centralize these services within a single platform.

Planned Technical Stack

1. Frontend: Flutter or React
2. Backend: Node.js or Django REST
3. Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB
4. APIs: Weather API, geolocation services
5. Future scope: Crop recommendation and yield prediction models
